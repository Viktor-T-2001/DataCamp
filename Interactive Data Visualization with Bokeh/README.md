## **Course Description**

Bokeh is a powerful Python package for interactive data visualization, enabling you to go beyond static plots and allow stakeholders to modify your visualizations! In this interactive data visualization with Bokeh course, you'll work with a range of datasets, including stock prices, basketball player statistics, and Australian real-estate sales data. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll build and customize a range of plots, including scatter, bar, line, and grouped bar plots. You'll also get to grips with configuration tools to change how viewers interact with your plot, discover Bokeh's custom themes, learn how to generate subplots, and even how to add widgets to your plots!
