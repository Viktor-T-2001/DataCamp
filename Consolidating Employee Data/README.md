## **Project Description**

Wouldn't it be great if your data was stored in your favorite format, ready to be analyzed? Unfortunately, that's rarely the case. Data comes in different formats, and being able to merge these different sources in a single file for analysis is a fundamental skill for any data practitioner.

In this project, you will import employee and human resources data in CSV, Excel, and JSON format. You will then merge it all into a single DataFrame, before cleaning it so that it is ready for use in your business.
